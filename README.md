# Word Guessing Game
#### Lab03 - System I.O
##### *Author: Andrew Roska*

------------------------------

## Description
A simple word game in the style of Hangman.  The program randomly selects from a list of words, and then the user tries to guess that word one letter at a time.  The user's prior guesses are shown at all times, as well as any letters that have been correctly guessed in the word being revealed.

Users can add and delete words from the word list via an Admin menu.
